# Crossover and mutation of the children

        # A common range for the crossover rate is between 0.6 and 0.9, but the optimal value can vary depending on
        # the problem. A value of 1.0 would mean that all pairs of parents will always undergo crossover,
        # which can be useful for certain problems but may also cause the algorithm to converge too quickly or not
        # explore enough of the search space. It is common to experiment with different values of the crossover rate
        # and observe the performance of the algorithm. The performance can be evaluated by monitoring the fitness of
        # the best solution found, the diversity of the population, and the convergence rate. Adjusting the crossover
        # rate can be done by hand, or by using adaptive techniques that adjust the value of the crossover rate based
        # on the performance of the algorithm during the optimization process.

        # In general, a high mutation rate can increase the exploration of the search space, but may also decrease
        # the stability of the algorithm and cause the algorithm to converge more slowly. On the other hand,
        # a low mutation rate can increase the stability of the algorithm, but may also limit the diversity of the
        # population and cause the algorithm to converge to suboptimal solutions.
        #
        # A common rule of thumb for setting the mutation rate is to start with a small value, such as 0.01,
        # and gradually increase or decrease it based on the performance of the algorithm. If the algorithm is not
        # exploring the search space enough, the mutation rate can be increased, and if the algorithm is converging
        # too quickly to suboptimal solutions, the mutation rate can be decreased.
        #
        # It's worth noting that the optimal mutation rate can also vary depending on the type of mutation operator
        # used. For example, a mutation operator that swaps two elements in the solution may require a different
        # mutation rate than a mutation operator that adds or removes an element from the solution.
